# StarfallServiceAndClient
Network Service and Client for Starfall


This is the Git for the Starfall network services (formery "Planet-Rise" ?)

The goal is to create a WCF service  and a client dll to use within Unity 3D to give the game 
Starfall a robust networking with matchmaker, serverside game evaluation and the like.
